# 1930 Helpline Improvement

## Introduction:
This application is the solution for the 1930 Helpline, Problem No:9 of The Police Hackathon. **1930 Helpline** is a Government Helpline where we can file complaints regarding any Financial cyber fraud. The main purpose of building this application is to manage cyber crime complaints of all nature including financial to reduce traffic on the 1930 helpline.

## Objective:
To manage the traffic of the Helpline, we have decided to build an **AI Integrated Web App** (Mobile and Desktop apps will be built too) in which a complainant can file any type of cyber complaint, and our AI Sorting system will Sort the complaint into the following categories:
+ Spam Complaints:- These complaints will be rejected immediately.
+ Minor Complaints:- If there is a minor issue like cyber harassment, etc. then the AI will give him an instant solution as well as the complainant has the option to start the further investigation. 
+ Major Complaints:- In this situation, the complaint will be immediately forwarded to the Higher Authorities for further investigations.

Then our AI-based Legal Advisory system will provide immediate legal advice to the user along with a Proper Tracking System to increase the user's faith.
