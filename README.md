#1930 Helpline Improvement

### Introduction:
This application is the solution for the 1930 Helpline. **1930 Helpline** is a Government Helpline where we can file complaints regarding any Cyber fraud. The main purpose of building this application is to manage the huge traffic of the helpline number.

##Objective:
To manage the traffic of the Helpline, we decided to build an **AI Integrated Web App** in which a complainant can file his complaint, and our AI Sorting system will Sort the complaint into the following categories:
+ Spam Complaints:- These complaints will be rejected immediately.
+ Minor Complaints:- If there is a minor issue like cyber harassment, etc. then the AI will give him an instant solution as well as the complainant has the option to start the further investigation. 
+ Major Complaints:- In this situation, the complaint will be immediately forwarded to the Higher Authorities for further investigations.
